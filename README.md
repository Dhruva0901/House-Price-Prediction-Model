# Real Estate Price Prediction Model

In this project, house prices will be predicted given explanatory variables that cover 
many aspects of residential houses. As continuous house prices, they will be predicted 
with two supervised machine learning algorithms like Decision tree and Random Forest 
algorithm and one unsupervised machine learning algorithm named Recurrent neural 
networks. We will also calculate R square value for each of the model to predict the 
accuracy. The goal of this project is to create a model that is able to accurately estimate 
the price of the house given the features

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

To build a Bengaluru real estate price prediction model with at least 10 features to predict the output variable. The algorithms used are Decision Tree, Random Forest and Recurrent neural networks. The error method used are root absolute error, root mean error, root mean square error (RMSE) and R square value.

## PROCESS STEPS

The entire process of machine learning is divided in 4 main steps to get the desired prediction.

• Get Data – Dataset is used in the project is about the Bengaluru house price prediction with features like area type, locality, total square foot area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms and balcony. Some more feature like parking facility and distance from main road are also added.

• Data Pre-Processing – It is technique of data cleaning which includes converting the raw data into modal usable data. Data correction, data manipulation, and missing data placement is covered in this step.

• Model Evaluation – Different machine learning algorithms are used and evaluated in this step to measure the accuracy and other performance metrics.

• Prediction – Depending on choice of the best model, prediction is done.
